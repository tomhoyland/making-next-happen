**What is it?**

The **Making Next Happen Canvas** is a simple and easy-to-adopt tool to help people identify what they need to move from where they are now to where they'd like to be - making what's next for them happen'. In the context of this document, the act and activities of moving from an existing situation to where a person would like to be is referred to as a 'transition'. 

The canvas encourages a person (the user) to:
1. Reflect on and define what change is about to take place.
2. Identify where a change is originating.
3. Clarify their motivation, what value a person seeks to gain from the situation and/or what value they will bring to being in a different situation or context.
4. Surface how a person would ideally like a change to go for them.
5. Build an inventory of what a person is currently involved in, identifying existing commitments and investments for them to consider.
6. Use the information revealed to develop a backlog of what needs to change to support a person's transition from where they are to where they'd like to be. This includes:

   6.a. Identifying what a person **Needs (Start, Increase, Change)** and **Does Not Need (Stop, Decrease, Change)**, from **Within (themselves)** or from **Others (People and Systems that are external to them)**.

   6.b. Classifying the changes identified as being related to **Activities** (how and where time and energy are invested, surfaced through previous questions), **Behaviours** (these are often internal to us e.g. what we pay attention to, how choices are made, biases, ways to interact, habits, reactions and responses etc.) or **Capabilities** (these are often external to us e.g. systems, processes, structures, money, reward systems, tools, etc.).

7. Use the backlog created to develop a plan, list or roadmap of steps to take and changes to implement, to support a successful transition from where they are, to where they would like to be - in a conscious, sustained way.



**Who is it for?**

Anyone who would like to understand better what steps or actions they need to take to support a change they are about to undertake, such as a new role, responsibility, project, professional or personal commitment.  



**When to use it**

1. Before embarking on a change - to surface what a person needs.
2. Understanding an existing change - helping a person to work through existing changes that are proving challenging.

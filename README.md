**What is it?**

The **Making Next Happen Canvas** is a simple and easy-to-adopt tool to help people identify what they need to move from where they are now to where they'd like to be - **Making Next Happen**. 



**Who is it for?**

Anyone who would like to better understand what steps or actions they need to take to support a change they are about to undertake. This could include a new role, responsibility, project, professional or personal commitment. 



**When to use it**

1. Before embarking on a change - to surface what a person needs.
2. Understanding an existing change - to review an existing change taking place to understand challenges and reduce friction. 



**How to use it**

Notes:
- In the context of this document, the act and activities of moving from an existing situation to where a person would like to be is referred to as a 'transition'. 

- The following quick start guide is written from a first-person perspective.


Download, copy or use the prompts in the canvas to: 
1. Reflect on and define what change is about to take place.
2. Identify where the change is originating.
3. Clarify your motivation(s), what value you seek to gain from the situation and/or what value you will bring to being in a different situation or context.
4. Surface how you would ideally like a change to go for you.
5. Build an inventory of what you are currently involved in, identifying existing commitments and investments for you to consider.
6. Use the information revealed to develop a backlog of what needs to change to support your transition from where you are to where you'd like to be. This includes:

   6.a. Identify what you **Need (Start, Increase, Change)** and **Don't Need (Stop, Decrease, Change)**, from **Within (yourself)** or from **Others (People and Systems that are external to you)**.

   6.b. Classify the changes identified as being related to **Activities** (how and where time and energy are invested, surfaced through previous questions), **Behaviours** (these are often internal to us e.g. what we pay attention to, how choices are made, biases, ways to interact, habits, reactions and responses etc.) or **Capabilities** (these are often external to us e.g. systems, processes, structures, money, reward systems, tools, etc.).

7. Use the backlog created to develop a list, plan or roadmap of steps to take and changes to implement, to support a successful transition from where you are, to where you would like to be - in a conscious, sustained way.

8. Try it out. See how you go. Revisit the canvas to see what worked and what didn't, what you uncovered and what needs to be revised, to Make Next Happen for you.

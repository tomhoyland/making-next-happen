**What is it?**

The Making Next Happen Canvas is a simple and easy-to-adopt tool to help a person identify what they need to move from where they are now to where they'd like to be - Making 'What's Next Happen'. In the context of this document, the act and activities of moving to where a person would like to be is referred to as a 'transition'. 

The canvas encourages a person to:
1. Reflect on and define what change is about to take place.
2. Identify where a change is originating and what a person seeks to gain or will contribute as part of it.
3. Surface how a person would like a change to go for them (ideally).
4. Build an inventory of what a person is currently involved in, creating a backlog of existing commitments and investments to consider.
5. Use the information revealed to develop a backlog of what needs to change to support a person's transition from where they are to where they'd like to be. This includes:

   5.a. Identifying what a person **Needs (Start, Increase, Change)** and **Does Not Need (Stop, Decrease, Change)**, from **Within (themselves)** or from **Others (People and Systems that are external to them)** to move them from where they are to where they would like to be.

   5.b. Classifying the changes identified as being related to **Activities** (the work they do and what they invest their time in, surfaced through previous questions), **Behaviours** (how they/others behave, interact, communicate etc. - often internal) or **Capabilities** (systems, processes, structures, money etc. - often external).



**Who is it for?**

Anyone who would like to better understand what steps or actions they need to take to support a change they are about to undertake, such as a new role, responsibility, project, professional or personal commitment.  



**When to use it**

1. Before embarking on a change - to surface what a person needs.
2. Understanding an existing change - helping a person to work through existing changes that are proving challenging.
